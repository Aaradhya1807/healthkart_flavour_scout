## 🎯 Business Problem

Flavor innovation in nutrition products often relies on intuition or delayed sales data.
By the time trends appear in dashboards, consumer interest may already be fading.

HealthKart needs a system that can:

Listen to early consumer conversations

Separate signal from noise

Clearly explain why a flavor is accepted or rejected

Recommend one high-confidence flavor for business action

## 🧠 Solution Overview

Flavor Scout Engine acts as a Decision Intelligence Layer between social chatter and product teams.

It does NOT just summarize comments — it reasons about them.

The system outputs:

Accepted flavor ideas (with scores + reasoning)

Rejected ideas (with rejection logic)

One Golden Candidate recommended for launch consideration

## 🔍 Decision Pipeline (End-to-End)
1️⃣ Social Media Data Collection

Input data simulates Reddit / review / comment-based chatter

Stored as a structured CSV (social_chatter.csv)

2️⃣ Signal Extraction & Trend Detection

Flavor keywords are identified

Mention frequency is calculated

High-noise, low-intent chatter is deprioritized

3️⃣ Explainable Scoring Engine (Core Logic)

Each flavor is evaluated on four independent dimensions:

Score Type	Description
Trend Score	How frequently & strongly the flavor is mentioned
Sentiment Score	Positive vs neutral vs negative context
Brand Fit Score	Alignment with HealthKart brands (MuscleBlaze, HK Vitals, etc.)
Signal Quality Score	Noise vs genuine consumer intent

A Final Score is computed using weighted reasoning.

## 🎯 Final Acceptance Logic

Each flavor receives a **Final Score (0–100)** computed using weighted contributions from:

- Trend Score  
- Sentiment Score  
- Brand Fit Score  
- Signal Quality Score  

**Decision Rules:**
- ✅ **ACCEPT** → Final Score **≥ 75** (High confidence, launch-worthy)
- ❌ **REJECT** → Final Score **< 75** (Weak signal or high noise)

This threshold-based approach ensures that only flavors with strong consumer demand,
brand alignment, and clear intent move forward — mirroring real-world product council decisions.


4️⃣ LLM-Based Decision Reasoning

A Large Language Model acts as a Product Analyst, using the scores to:

ACCEPT strong flavor ideas

REJECT weak or noisy ideas (with reasons)

Justify each decision in business language

The LLM returns strict structured JSON, enabling transparency and auditability.

5️⃣ Golden Candidate Selection

The system selects ONE flavor with:

Highest final score

Strong brand alignment

Clear launch justification

This mirrors how real product councils operate.

## 📊 Output Example
✅ Accepted Flavors

Masala Chai — MuscleBlaze
High cultural relevance, frequent mentions, strong post-workout positioning

Nimbu Pani — HK Vitals
Refreshing wellness association with hydration use-cases

❌ Rejected Flavors

Low mention frequency

Ambiguous sentiment

Weak product-market fit

Each rejection includes a clear explanation.

🏆 Golden Candidate

Masala Chai Whey — MuscleBlaze

Strong trend momentum, emotional recall, and brand synergy for Indian fitness consumers.
